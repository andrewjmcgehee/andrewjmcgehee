i haven't worked for most of these companies – only google, really. i think it offers an appealing illusion that i might have, though. 
in case that hasn't convinced you, o mighty recruiter, i'd just like to say...

i use neovim BTW. i also installed arch once BTW.


more seriously, my favorite moments in life have been when i knew nothing and learned a skill for the first time.
i'm constantly chasing that. i spend a lot of time training jiu jitsu, writing code, drinking
coffee, and exploring whatever my current obsession might be. right now it's split keyboards, colemak,
and learning to touch type.

past flavors:
- designing and building guitar pedals
- chess
- learning russian
- playing the spoons
- playing around with go

future flavors might be:
- building my family a highly available home media k8s cluster
- 3D modeling and aluminum CNC
- learning zig
- youtubing
