# yo ✌️

i'm a software engineer that is learning to take myself less seriously. lately i've been enjoying
learning colemak and optimizing my vim flow so that i can shave a few nanoseconds off every
keystroke - i'm gonna be lightyears ahead of all these vibe-coders in no time. 

check out all these logos:

i haven't worked for most of these. but i think it makes my profile look more hirable. the first
logo is mine.
